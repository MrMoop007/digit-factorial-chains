Take any number. Sum the factorials of its digits (e.g. 617 -> 6! + 1! + 7! = 5761). Keep doing this until you get stuck in a loop. The number of unique numbers you've encountered is considered the length of the digit factorial chain. For some numbers (145 and 40585) the length of this chain is 0, as the sum of the factorial of their digits is themselves. This program returns the number of numbers below 1 million which have a chain 60 numbers long, which is the longest chain any number below 60 has.
